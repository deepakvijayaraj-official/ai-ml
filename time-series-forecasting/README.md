## Time Series Forecasting for Resource Usage

### Use time series forecasting to predict resource usage (e.g., CPU, memory, disk) and detect anomalies.

This code example has two files for time series forecasting of resource usage using the Prophet library. Libraries used are:
* matplotlib
* plotly

This code assumes you have the plotly and matplotlib library installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so with:

```
pip install plotly matplotlib
```
Make sure to replace 'resource_usage.csv' with the path to your actual resource usage data CSV file. 
The format of your 'resource_usage.csv' file should typically include two columns: one for the timestamp (date and time) and another for the resource usage values.

- The 'ds' column represents the timestamp, and it should be in a consistent date and time format, such as 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.
- The 'resource_usage' column contains the numeric values indicating the resource usage at each corresponding timestamp.

Make sure to adjust the column names and data format to match your actual resource usage data. The 'Prophet' library in the code example expects this specific format for the CSV file.

For matplotlib

This code uses the Prophet library to create a time series forecasting model and then generates predictions for the specified number of hours into the future. The forecast results are plotted using matplotlib.

For plotly

The code will produce an interactive time series plot using plotly, allowing you to zoom, pan, and hover over data points for additional information. Make sure you've configured your environment to support graphical output for plotly to work correctly.
