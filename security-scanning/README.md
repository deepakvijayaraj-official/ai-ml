## Security Scanning

### ML models can scan code for security vulnerabilities.

Creating a complete code for a machine learning model to scan code for security vulnerabilities is a complex task, as it typically involves the development and training of a custom model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, I have provided below with a simplified example using a pre-trained model and libraries to scan code for potential security vulnerabilities.

In this example, we'll use the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides pre-trained models for various NLP tasks, and we'll focus on using a model for text classification. For code scanning, you may want to use models that specialize in security vulnerabilities, but you can adapt this code accordingly.

In this code, we :

* Use the Hugging Face Transformers library to load a pre-trained text classification model (you may need a specific security-focused model for your use case).
* Define a list of code snippets to scan for vulnerabilities. You can extend this list with your code samples.
* Use the pre-trained model to classify each code snippet.

We print the label and confidence score for each code snippet. The label indicates whether the code is classified as a security vulnerability or not.

Please note that a real-world code security scanner would require a more complex model, extensive training data, and additional preprocessing specific to the code. Additionally, a production-level system would need more comprehensive error handling and a user-friendly interface.

Building a robust code security scanner is a significant undertaking and may involve a team of experts in machine learning, security, and software engineering. You should also consider legal and ethical considerations when scanning code for vulnerabilities.
