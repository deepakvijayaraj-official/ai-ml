## Predictive Scaling

### Machine learning models can predict future resource requirements, allowing for auto-scaling.

Predictive scaling typically involves automatically adjusting the number of resources (e.g., servers or containers) based on predictions of future demand. Here's a simplified Python code example using a hypothetical predictive model that forecasts demand and adjusts the number of resources accordingly.

Please note that this is a simplified code and does not include a real predictive model. It demonstrates the concept of predictive scaling.

* predict_demand() represents a function that simulates demand prediction. In a real system, you would use a predictive model to forecast demand.

* adjust_resources(predicted_demand, current_resources) adjusts resources based on the predicted demand. If the predicted demand is higher than the current resources, it increases resources, and if it's lower, it decreases resources.

* The simulation loop runs for a specified duration and periodically predicts demand and adjusts resources based on the predictions.

* Please replace the predict_demand() function with a real predictive model tailored to your use case. In practice, you would also implement the resource scaling logic specific to your infrastructure, such as scaling cloud resources or containerized applications.
